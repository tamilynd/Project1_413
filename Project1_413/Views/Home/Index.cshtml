<!--Basic info about tour-->
      <p>Families or groups can come for a tour of the perimeter of the temple site after 5:00 Monday through Friday, or on Saturday. Due to the time change 
    in November, the cooler weather, and the popularity of the tours, we have limited times still available to walk around the outside fence. We are already 
    booking groups for next spring. We also allow family groups to come to the trailer on Sunday afternoons for inside tours only. Families larger than 8 people
    will need to schedule more than one half-hour time slot.  We have obligations during the day and we do the tours in the evenings, so we're not able to answer
    the phone to set appointments</p>
